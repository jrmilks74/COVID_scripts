# COVID_scripts
R scripts to calculate per capita total and daily infection and death rates for 185 countries using John Hopkins University COVID data and world population counts.

The first script (COVID_script) calculates per capita total and daily infection rates then plots those rates over time for ten First World nations.

The second script (COVID_deaths) calculates per capita total and daily death rates then plots those rates over time for the same ten First World nations.
